## Description

This repository contains a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from crossing their side of the screen. The game ends when one of the players reaches a certain score threshold.

5. Player 1 (left side) can control their paddle using the `W` and `S` keys to move up and down, respectively.

6. Player 2 (right side) can control their paddle using the arrow keys `UP` and `DOWN`.

7. The game will continue until one player reaches the specified score, and the winner will be displayed on the screen.
